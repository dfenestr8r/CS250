* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
  Gathering information from users can yield valuable information about what is needed or wanted from a product, but not all of this information is useful. Creating user stories based on this information helps developers     
imagine realistic use cases and design a product with the most relevant features.


* How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  
  My development approach when creating software on my own has involved a lot of trial and error, which can be useful for learning, but inefficient for actually creating a product in a timely manner. Utilizing Agile practices in future work, especially with others, will lead to more useful code and effective time management. Some Agile approaches that can be applied in a solo setting are sprints, time-boxing, and backlog prioritization.

  
* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  
  Being a good team member is all about effective communication. To work effectively on a team, it is necessary to create good documentation, understand your own responsibilities, and make sure your work is providing value to the larger project.
